# ai_filemetadata

Automatically generates FAL metadata (alternative texts, for the time being) for files by means of public LLMs. 

This extension helps you to **automate the process of generating such alternative texts** for images. It serves as a preparation for **EU Directive 2019/882** on the accessibility requirements for products and services (German: BarrierefreiheitsstÃ¤rkungsgesetz (BFSG)).

The extension generates descriptive text for images, making them accessible to visually impaired individuals, 
e.g. when using screen reader software. It is not intended to create SEO-related texts.
